# Extension - Fiori Launchpad Integration (on-premise)

### ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

* this repository provides an UI5 app which can be deployed to an on-premise system or the business technology platform. By adding this app to a launchpad abap2UI5 apps can be called via the on-premise Fiori Launchpad or SAP Build Work Zone Launchpad
* the app does not contain any extra logic, it just reads the launchpad configuration and calls abap2UI5
* add the app multiple times to start different abap2UI5 apps
* precondition: Install abap2UI5 first
